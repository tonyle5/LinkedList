- How well did the data structure selected perform for the assigned
  application?

  The linked list is suitable for storing the song list since it is easier
  to add or remove a song from the list as it doesn't require shifting many
  elements to add or remove a song.

- Would a different data structure work better? If so, which one and why...

  This data structure is very suitable for our use case.

- What was efficient about your design and use of the data structure?

  I used recursion to remove songs with fewer likes.

- What would you do differently if you had more time to solve the problem?

  If I had more time to solve the problem, I could implement algorithms to
  search for songs of an artist in a case-insensitive manner. Additionally,
  I would like to populate the song list in alphabetical order if songs have
  the same number of likes.
