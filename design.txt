Project 1 design write-up

1. What functions your ADT will need to have?
- The Song ADT includes:
  + A constructor initializes the song information, including artistName,
    title, length, numberOfLikes.
  + Getters and setters
  + A print function prints the song information.

- The SongList ADT includes:
  + A Node struct includes data members and next pointer member. This pointer
    points to another Node in the SongList.
  + A head pointer points to the first node of the SongList and the tail
    pointer points to the last node of the SongList.
  + A construct initializes the data members.
  + A destructor releases all dynamic memory and resets data members to their
    zero equivalent value.
  + A function adds a new song.
  + A function edits the number of likes for a song.
  + A function displays all songs in the list.
  + A function displays all songs for an artist (in order of popularity).
  + A function removes all songs with fewer than M likes, where M is sent in
    as an argument.


2. How each function will report success/failure back to the calling routine?

3. How each function will shield the client program from the details of the data structure?

4. What data structures you will be using and how each of the special cases. Consider drawing pointer diagrams with “before” and “after” diagrams for each special case.

5. Which function/functions are recursive?
